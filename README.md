# Jetpack Compose Navigation Practice App

This is a practice app created to explore **Jetpack Compose** navigation, focusing on **nested navigation** and **form validation**. The project uses **MVI architecture** for state management, **Flows and Channels** for one-shot events, and **Hilt** for dependency injection, along with **Form Validator** for field validation.

## Features

- **Nested Navigation**: Efficiently managing navigation between multiple screens.
- **Form Validator**: Ensures a seamless user experience by validating fields before submission.
- **MVI Architecture**: Clear and maintainable state management with **states** and **channels** for handling one-shot events like Snackbars and screen navigation.
- **Flows and Channels**: Implemented for reactive programming, handling one-time events.
- **Hilt**: Provides dependency injection for modular, decoupled code with **binds** to abstract repositories.

## Technologies Used

- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for Android development.
- **MVI Architecture**: For managing UI states and events.
- **Flows and Channels**: For one-shot event handling and reactivity.
- **Form Validator**: Ensures correct data entry before submitting forms.
- **Hilt**: For dependency injection and modularity.
- **Kotlin**: The programming language used for development.

## Work in Progress

The project is a work in progress with ongoing improvements and feature integrations. Currently, the project focuses on navigation and form validation.
